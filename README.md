# Bio-PT: Open-Source 3D Bio-Printer

**Bio-PT** is an affordable, open-source 3D bio-printer designed to make bio-printing accessible to students, researchers, and makers worldwide. Built primarily from recycled materials and commonly available components, Bio-PT aims to reduce e-waste and carbon footprint while providing a powerful platform for bio-printing research and prototyping.

The Bio-PT operates using a modified version of Marlin firmware (1.1.9), termed **Bio-Marlin**, which enables the printer to work efficiently with an indirect syringe pump. The design uses CD-ROM drive motors, a 3D-printed frame, and an indirect extrusion system to minimize costs and weight on the X and Z axes.

## Features

- **Affordable**: Bio-PT is designed with low-cost components, making bio-printing accessible for academic and hobbyist purposes.
- **Sustainable Design**: The frame and majority of components are 3D-printed or sourced from recycled materials, reducing e-waste and overall cost.
- **Indirect Syringe Pump Extruder**: Lightweight, indirect extrusion reduces load on the X and Z axes, improving performance.
- **Modified Firmware**: Bio-PT runs on Bio-Marlin, a version of Marlin firmware modified to accommodate bio-printing needs.
- **Compatibility**: Works with RAMPS boards and MKS boards with built-in IC drivers.

## Hardware Overview

### 3D Printed Frame
- Designed for FDM 3D printers.
- Parts can be assembled with M3 x 6mm fasteners, which are easy to source globally.

### Motion System
- Utilizes CD-ROM drive motors for X, Y, and Z movement, which greatly reduces the cost of traditional motors.
- Supports smooth movement and controlled extrusion.

### Extrusion Mechanism
- Indirect syringe pump serves as the extruder, helping to maintain minimal weight on the moving axes.
- Ideal for printing bio-materials or experimental composites.

## Firmware - Bio-Marlin

Bio-PT operates using **Bio-Marlin**, a customized firmware derived from Marlin 1.1.9. Bio-Marlin has been tailored specifically for bio-printing by incorporating features to support indirect syringe extrusion and eliminating heat-related functionalities to match the unique needs of bio-materials.

- **Current Version**: Beta
- **Modifications Include**:
  - Disabled heating elements to support room-temperature extrusion.
  - Customized extruder settings to allow fine-tuning of extrusion for bio-materials.
  - Reduced footprint on processing to work seamlessly with lower-cost boards.

You can download Bio-Marlin from the [Firmware](#) folder in this repository : [Bio-Marlin V1.2 firmware](https://github.com/dr-islam-sa/Bio-Marline) ‚Äî a modified version of Marlin tailored for bioprinting applications. Bio-Marlin focuses on enhanced control for bio-inks and optimized settings for 3D bioprinting needs.

## Assembly Instructions

1. **3D Print Frame Components**:
   - Print all frame parts using PLA or ABS (or other FDM-compatible materials) and assemble using M3 x 6mm fasteners.
  
2. **Install Motors and Drive Components**:
   - Secure CD-ROM motors for X, Y, and Z axes using the pre-designed mounting areas on the frame.
  
3. **Attach Syringe Pump Extruder**:
   - Set up the syringe pump as the extruder mechanism, ensuring it is positioned to reduce load on the X and Z axes.
  
4. **Connect Electronics**:
   - Use the RAMPS or MKS board to connect motors and extruder. Follow the wiring diagram provided in the `Documentation` folder.

## Setup and Usage

### Initial Setup
1. **Upload Bio-Marlin Firmware**:
   - Compile and upload the customized Bio-Marlin firmware to your controller board.
  
2. **Calibration**:
   - Calibrate the printer for X, Y, and Z movement and set the extrusion parameters.
  
3. **Syringe Loading**:
   - Carefully load your bio-material into the syringe. Ensure it is compatible with the printer specifications.

### Printing
1. Load your model in your preferred slicer software.
2. Export the G-code and run it on Bio-PT.
3. Monitor the print to ensure proper extrusion and movement.

## Environmental Impact

Bio-PT is designed with sustainability in mind:
- **Recycled Materials**: Using recycled parts, especially the CD-ROM motors, minimizes environmental impact.
- **Carbon Footprint Reduction**: By choosing 3D-printed parts and recycled components, Bio-PT contributes to a reduced carbon footprint in comparison to conventional manufacturing.
- **Low-Energy Consumption**: The choice of lightweight materials and efficient motors keeps the printer‚Äôs power consumption low.

## FAQ

**Q1: What materials can Bio-PT print?**  
Bio-PT is primarily designed for bio-materials that can be extruded from a syringe, such as gels, pastes, and soft polymers. Avoid using traditional filament-based materials.

**Q2: Is the firmware fully stable?**  
Bio-Marlin is currently in beta, so some features are still being optimized for bio-printing.

**Q3: How can I get replacement parts?**  
Most parts are easily replaceable with standard hardware. The STL files for 3D printing the frame are available in the repository.
